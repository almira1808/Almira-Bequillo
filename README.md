      Bini debuted on June 11, 2021, with their single, "Born to Win", after three years of training under SHA. Before their debut, the group released a pre-debut single, "Da Coconut Nut", on November 20, 2020. The group has since then gained widespread recognition and has been dubbed as the "Nation's Girl Group" due to their significant impact on the public and Philippine pop music. They became the first Filipino pop group with the most monthly listeners on Spotify, and the first to top Billboard's Philippine Songs Chart. They are also the first to receive the Billboard Philippines Women in Music "Rising Star" Award. Bini was also recognized as the number one Philippine act by Billboard Philippines, representing the Philippines in Billboard's inaugural Global No.1 series.
